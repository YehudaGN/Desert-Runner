1. Background and Overview

In this game, the player will be running from left to right
along the screen. There will be obstacles to jump over or 
duck under, as well as gaps to jump across to other platforms.

There is list of instructions as well as the option 
to choose which character to play as. There is a scoring 
system that displays after death and determines how well
you did on any individual run. The games difficulty increases
dynamically as the game goes on. There is also a difficulty 
indicator that displays the current difficulty as the game 
goes on. 

2. Functionality and MVPs

In Endless Runner (working title), users will be able to:

Start a new game / reset a run

In addition, the following is included:

3. Wireframes
