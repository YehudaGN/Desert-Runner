<h1>1. Background and Overview</h1>

In this game, the player will be running from left to right
along the screen. There will be obstacles to jump over or 
duck under, as well as gaps to jump across to other platforms.

There is a list of instructions as well as the option 
to choose which character to play as. There is a scoring 
system that displays after death and determines how well
you did on any individual run. The games difficulty increases
dynamically as the game goes on. There is also a difficulty 
indicator that displays the current difficulty as the game 
goes on. 

<h1>2. Functionality and MVPs</h1>

In Desert Runner, users will be able to:

- Collide with obstacles which ends the game.

- Avoid randomly generated obstacles which appear at the edge of the screen and move towards the player.

- Start a new game / reset a run

- Jump or duck to avoid obstacles or gaps

 

In addition, the following is included:

- A "How to Play" instructions modal explaining the rules of the game

- A production README

<h1>3. Wireframes</h1>

The screen has a restart button, a How to Play, a difficulty
indicator, a charactor selector, as well as links to the repo
and of course the game itself.
